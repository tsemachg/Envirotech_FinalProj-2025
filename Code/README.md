## Readme

The main arduino code is in `sketch_june8a`, the folder "envirotech_sketch_may28a" is an earlier prototype without Notehub integration.

### Note

The Grove sensor need external installation; libarary "Seeed_PM2_5_sensor_HM3301-master.zip" "basic_demo.ino" code is a bit outdated:
*  Need to change line 35 "SerialUSB" -> "Serial" in the Arduino IDE.
