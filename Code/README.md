# Folder contents:

The main arduino code is in `sketch_june8a`, the folder "envirotech_sketch_may28a" is an earlier prototype without Notehub integration.<br>
The `JSONata` folder is for porcessing at blues-notehub.io when routing to ThingSpeak.<br>
And `Matlab-ThingSpeak` folder contains code for generating the dashboard components.

### Note

The Grove sensor need external installation of the library "Seeed_PM2_5_sensor_HM3301-master.zip"; in addition its "basic_demo.ino" code is a bit outdated:
*  Need to change line 35 "SerialUSB" -> "Serial" in the Arduino IDE.
